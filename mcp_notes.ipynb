    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Start here](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/en/unit1/key-concepts)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concepts and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is often described as the \"USC=C for AI applications.\" Just as USB-C provides a standardized physical and logical interface for connecting various peripherals to computing devices, MCP offers a consistent protocol for linking AI models to external capabilities. This standardization benefits the entire ecosystem:\n",
    "* users enjoy simpler and more consistent experiences across AI applications\n",
    "* AI application developers gain easy integration with a growing ecosystem of tools and data sources\n",
    "* tool and data providers need only create a single implementation that works with multiple AI applications\n",
    "* the broader ecosystem benefits from increased interoperability, innovation, and reduced fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Integration Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MxN Integration Problem** refers to the challenge of connecting M different AI applications to N different external tools or data sources without a standardized approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Without MCP (M×N Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a protocol like MCP, developers would need to create M×N custom integrations—one for each possible pairing of an AI application with an external capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AI application would need to integrate with each tool/data source individually. This is a very complex and expensive process which introduces a lot of friction for developers, and high maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have multiple models and multiple tools, the number of integrations becomes too large to manage, each with its own unique interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## With MCP (M+N Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP transforms this into an M+N problem by providing a standard interface: each AI application implements the client side of MCP once, and each tool/data source implements the server side once. This dramatically reduces integration complexity and maintenance burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core MCP Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is a standard like HTTP or USB-C, and is a protocol for connecting AI applications to external tools and data sources. Therefore, using standard terminology is crucial to making the MCP work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When documenting our applications and communicating with the community, we should use the following terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like client server relationships in HTTP, MCP has a client and a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Host:** The user-facing AI application that end-users interact with directly. Examples include Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor, inference libraries like Hugging Face Python SDK, or custom applications built in libraries like LangChain or smolagents. Hosts initiate connections to MCP Servers and orchestrate the overall flow between user requests, LLM processing, and external tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client:** A component within the host application that manages communication with a specific MCP Server. Each Client maintains a 1:1 connection with a single Server, handling the protocol-level details of MCP communication and acting as an intermediary between the Host’s logic and the external Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Server:** An external program or service that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) via the MCP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Terminology](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/en/unit1/key-concepts#capabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then there's a bunch of other stuff you're better off just reading instead of typing along to.**"

    "# The Communication Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "[Resource](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/en/unit1/communication-protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP defines a standardized communication protocol that enables Clients and Servers to exchange messages in a consistent, predictable way. This standardization is critical for interoperability across the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON-RPC: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, MCP uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** as the message format for all communication between clients and servers. JSON-RPC is a lightweight remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON, which makes it:\n",
    "* Human-readable and easy to debug\n",
    "* Language-agnostic, supporting implementation in any programming environment\n",
    "* Well-established, with clear specifications and widespread adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol defines three types of messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Sent from Client to Server to initiate an operation. A request message includes:\n",
    "* A unique ID (`id`)\n",
    "* The method name to invoke (e.g. `tools/call`)\n",
    "* Parameters for the method (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example request:"

    "## Transport Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON-RPC defines the message format, but MCP also specifies how these messages are transported between Clients and Servers. Two primary transport mechanisms are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### stdio (Standard Input/Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "The stdio transport is used for local communication, where the Client and Server run on the same machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Host application launches the Server as a subprocess and communicates with it by writing to its standard input (stdin) and reading from its standard output (stdout).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases for this transport are local tools like file system access or running local scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main Advantages of this transport are that it’s simple, no network configuration required, and securely sandboxed by the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events) / Streamable HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP+SSE transport is used for remote communication, where the Client and Server might be on different machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication happens over HTTP, with the Server using Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates to the Client over a persistent connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases for this transport are connecting to remote APIs, cloud services, or shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main Advantages of this transport are that it works across networks, enables integration with web services, and is compatible with serverless environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent updates to the MCP standard have introduced or refined “Streamable HTTP,” which offers more flexibility by allowing servers to dynamically upgrade to SSE for streaming when needed, while maintaining compatibility with serverless environments.\n",
