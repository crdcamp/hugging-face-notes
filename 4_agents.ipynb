    "Your Agent, named Alfred, will handle a simple task and demonstrate how to apply these concepts in practice.\n",

    "## What is an Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the Agent as having two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Brain (AI Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where all the thinking happens. The AI model handles reasoning and planning. It decides which Actions to take based on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Body (Capabilities and Tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "This part represents everything the Agent is equipped to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of possible actions depends on what the agent has been equipped with. For example, because humans lack wings, they can’t perform the “fly” Action, but they can execute Actions like “walk”, “run” ,“jump”, “grab”, and so on."
