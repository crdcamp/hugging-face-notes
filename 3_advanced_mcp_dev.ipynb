    "**PR Agent Workflow Server** - An MCP server that demonstrates how to make Claude Code team-aware and workflow-intelligent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smart PR Management: Automatic PR template selection based on code changes using MCP Tools\n",
    "* CI/CD Monitoring: Track GitHub Actions with Cloudflare Tunnel and standardized Prompts\n",

    "We’ll implement a practical scenario every development team faces:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before: Developer manually creates PRs, waits for Actions to complete, manually checks results, remembers to notify team members\n",
    "\n",
    "After: Claude Code connected to your workflow server can intelligently:\n",
    "* Suggest the right PR template based on changed files\n",
    "* Monitor GitHub Actions runs and provide formatted summaries\n",
    "* Automatically notify team via Slack when deployments succeed/fail\n",

    "# Claude Code installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not liking where this is going... time to [setup Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/getting-started).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've decided that I'm not doing this. Why give Anthropic full access to your repositories to fix your shitty employees' commit messages? Either put those retards in a wake-up call of a meeting or find new people to work for you. Also, does this *really* require Claude Code? Couldn't you just run local models on a Colab notebook and avoid handing over your companies private information on a SILVER FUCKING PLATTER!?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like... jesus christ who does this help? Lazy people who don't want to do their jobs correctly? Fuck this."
